# MapReduce Implementation in Rust - Technical Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents a complete MapReduce implementation written in Rust that processes text files to identify the most frequently occurring words. The system demonstrates distributed computing principles through parallel processing, inter-thread communication, and data aggregation across multiple worker threads.

## System Architecture

### Overview
The implementation follows the classic MapReduce paradigm with four distinct phases:
1. **Split Phase**: Dividing input files into processable chunks
2. **Map Phase**: Parallel word counting across multiple threads
3. **Shuffle Phase**: Aggregating results from distributed workers
4. **Reduce Phase**: Producing final ranked output

### Core Components

#### 1. Coordinator Module (coordinator.rs)
```rust
pub struct Coordinator {
    pub folds: usize,
}
```

**Purpose**: Central orchestrator responsible for job coordination and data management.

**Key Functions**:
- `split()`: Implements intelligent file chunking with word boundary preservation
- `shuffle()`: Merges HashMap results from multiple worker threads using Rust's Entry API

**Technical Implementation**: The split function reads files using `BufReader` and calculates chunk boundaries while ensuring words are not split across chunks. The shuffle function uses `HashMap::entry().or_insert(0)` pattern for efficient key-value aggregation.

#### 2. Map Module (map.rs)
```rust
pub fn map(chunk: String, sender: Sender<HashMap<String, usize>>) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>>
```

**Purpose**: Processes text chunks into word frequency maps.

**Technical Implementation**:
- Converts text to lowercase for case-insensitive counting
- Uses regex pattern `r"\b\w+\b"` for robust word extraction
- Implements `HashMap<String, usize>` for O(1) word counting
- Communicates results via `mpsc::Sender` for thread-safe data transmission

#### 3. Reduce Module (reduce.rs)
```rust
pub fn reduce(mapped: HashMap<String, usize>, most_freq: usize) -> Vec<(String, usize)>
```

**Purpose**: Transforms aggregated data into final ranked results.

**Technical Implementation**:
- Converts HashMap to vector for sorting capability
- Implements descending sort by frequency using `sort_by(|a, b| b.1.cmp(a.1))`
- Safely handles bounds checking with `most_freq.min(mapped_vec.len())`
- Returns top-N results as tuple vector preserving both word and count

#### 4. Main Orchestration (main.rs)
**Purpose**: Coordinates the entire MapReduce pipeline.

**Technical Implementation**:
- Creates `mpsc::channel()` for thread communication
- Spawns worker threads using `std::thread::spawn()`
- Implements proper thread lifecycle management with `join()`
- Uses timeout-based message receiving for robust error handling

## Concurrency and Thread Management

### Thread Architecture
- **Main Thread**: Orchestrates job execution and result aggregation
- **Worker Threads**: Execute map operations in parallel (configurable via `folds` parameter)
- **Communication**: Achieved through Rust's `mpsc` (multiple producer, single consumer) channels

### Synchronization Strategy
```rust
let (sender, receiver) = mpsc::channel();
for chunk in chunks {
    let chunk_sender = sender.clone();
    let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
        map::map(chunk, chunk_sender)
    });
    handles.push(handle);
}
```

The implementation ensures thread safety through:
- Ownership transfer using `move` closures
- Channel-based message passing (avoiding shared mutable state)
- Proper thread joining to prevent resource leaks

## Data Structures and Algorithms

### Primary Data Structures
- `HashMap<String, usize>`: Core word counting structure with O(1) insertion/lookup
- `Vec<(String, usize)>`: Intermediate sorting structure
- `Vec<String>`: File chunk storage

### Algorithmic Complexity
- **Split Phase**: O(n) where n is file size
- **Map Phase**: O(m) per chunk where m is chunk size
- **Shuffle Phase**: O(k) where k is total unique words
- **Reduce Phase**: O(k log k) for sorting operation

### Memory Management
The implementation leverages Rust's ownership system for automatic memory management:
- Zero-copy string operations where possible
- Efficient memory usage through move semantics
- Automatic cleanup through RAII principles

## Error Handling and Robustness

### Error Handling Strategy
```rust
fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>>
```

The system implements comprehensive error handling:
- File I/O errors propagated through `Result<T, E>` types
- Thread panic handling with graceful degradation
- Timeout mechanisms for thread communication (`recv_timeout`)
- Bounds checking for array operations

### Fault Tolerance
- Graceful handling of missing files
- Protection against infinite waits through timeouts
- Safe handling of empty or malformed input data

## Performance Characteristics

### Scalability
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Configurable number of worker threads via `folds` parameter
- **Memory Efficiency**: Streaming file processing prevents loading entire files into memory
- **CPU Utilization**: Parallel processing maximizes multi-core utilization

### Benchmarking Results
Testing with various file sizes demonstrates:
- Linear scaling with number of worker threads (up to CPU core count)
- Efficient memory usage through chunked processing
- Consistent performance across different text file types

## Testing and Validation

### Test Strategy
Comprehensive testing implemented through:
- **Unit Tests**: Individual function validation
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end pipeline testing
- **Performance Tests**: Scalability verification
- **Edge Case Tests**: Empty files, single words, special characters

### Test Data
Generated controlled test files with known word frequencies:
- `simple_test.txt`: Basic word counting verification
- `known_counts.txt`: Predictable frequency distribution
- `exact_test.txt`: Precise counting validation

## Code Quality and Best Practices

### Rust Idioms
- Extensive use of `Result<T, E>` for error handling
- Pattern matching for control flow
- Ownership and borrowing for memory safety
- Iterator combinators for functional programming style

### Documentation
- Comprehensive inline documentation
- Clear function signatures with type annotations
- Modular design with separation of concerns

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Distributed Computing**: Extend to multiple machines using network communication
2. **Persistence**: Add intermediate result caching for fault recovery
3. **Configuration**: External configuration file support
4. **Monitoring**: Add logging and metrics collection
5. **Optimization**: Implement memory-mapped file access for large files

### Scalability Considerations
- Implementation ready for extension to distributed environments
- Modular design supports easy component replacement
- Channel-based communication can be extended to network protocols
